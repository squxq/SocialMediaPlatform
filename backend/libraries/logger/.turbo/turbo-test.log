ts-jest[ts-jest-transformer] (WARN) Got a `.js` file to compile while `allowJs` option is not set to `true` (file: /home/squxq/Desktop/SocialMediaPlatform/backend/libraries/request-context/.dist/index.js). To fix this:
  - if you want TypeScript to process JS files, set `allowJs` to `true` in your TypeScript config (usually tsconfig.json)
  - if you do not want TypeScript to process your `.js` files, in your Jest config change the `transform` key which value is `ts-jest` so that it does not match `.js` files anymore
